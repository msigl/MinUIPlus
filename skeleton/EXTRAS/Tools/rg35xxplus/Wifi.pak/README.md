# minui-wifi.pak

A MinUI app that manages wifi connections.

## Requirements

This pak is designed and tested on the following MinUI Platforms and devices:

- `tg5040`: Trimui Brick (formerly `tg3040`), Trimui Smart Pro
- `rg35xxplus`: RG-35XX Plus, RG-34XX, RG-35XX H, RG-35XX SP

Use the correct platform for your device.

## Installation

1. Mount your MinUI SD card.
2. Download the latest release from Github. It will be named `Wifi.pak.zip`.
3. Copy the zip file to `/Tools/$PLATFORM/Wifi.pak.zip`.
4. Extract the zip in place, then delete the zip file.
5. Confirm that there is a `/Tools/$PLATFORM/Wifi.pak/launch.sh` file on your SD card.
6. Unmount your SD Card and insert it into your MinUI device.

## Usage

Browse to `Tools > Wifi` and press `A` to enter the wifi management screen. It will display your current wifi connection status, and allow you to scan for available networks as well as connect to them (with password entry).

### Debug Logging

To enable debug logging, create a file named `debug` in the pak folder. Logs will be written to the `$SDCARD_PATH/.userdata/$PLATFORM/logs/` folder.

### Customizing Wifi Credentials

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Wifi pak exposes a UI for managing wifi networks, so this is only relevant for prepopulating the wifi credentials file.

In the root of your SD card, place a `wifi.txt` file. This file should store network credentials for accessing your wifi networks.

> [!NOTE]
> In previous versions of the pak, this file could also be located at `/Tools/tg5040/Wifi.pak/wifi.txt`. The old path is still supported - though deprecated - and users should migrate to the new path. New versions of the pak will transparently migrate the `wifi.txt` to the root of the SD card.

Format:

- colon (`:`) delimited key/value pair, where the key is the network name, and the value is the credential for the network.
- Empty lines and lines beginning with hashes (`#`) are ignored
- Whitespace is stripped from network names and credentials

The following is an example:

```shell
# awesome wifi for home
Minui Rules:shauninman-too

# the previous newline is ignored
madison:CatmillaNumber1
```
